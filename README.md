## How to cherry-pick the commits required for MicroG:

Go in source/frameworks/base and run the following command:

    $ git remote add microg https://github.com/Thespartann/android_frameworks_base_microG.git

    $ git fetch microg

    $ git cherry-pick xxxx  [xxxx is the commit you want to cherry pick]

Example: [Nougat]

    $ git cherry-pick 067a593747eb28290a7a790868377613552fd988

    $ git cherry-pick 02532e93e3189a00db1f8b9f499071c14ed6695d



The Location-providers.patch patch was not cherry picked as it might be unsafe. If you still want to use it, you can apply the patch file to your frameworks base.
